# Uncommon HTML DOM Manipulation Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to removing elements from the HTML DOM.  The primary issue lies in attempting to remove a DOM element twice using different methods, once using `remove()` and again via `parentNode.removeChild()`. While `remove()` is the modern and preferred method, this example shows the unexpected behavior that can occur.  The solution provides a corrected approach focusing on using only one method to remove the element.

## Bug Description
The bug occurs when trying to remove the same element twice using different methods. `remove()` method successfully removes the element. Any subsequent attempt to remove the same element (now already removed) leads to no error but does not make any change to the DOM either. 

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
3. Observe the console (for any errors) and that the div with id "myDiv" is removed using the remove() method, but not with the second method. 

## Solution
The solution demonstrates the correct approach using only the `remove()` method or only `parentNode.removeChild()`. Avoiding redundant removal attempts leads to predictable behavior.
